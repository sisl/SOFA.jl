Form the celestial to terrestrial matrix given the date, the UT1,
the CIP coordinates and the polar motion.  IAU 2000.

This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.

Status:  support function.

Given:
   tta,ttb  double         TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
   uta,utb  double         UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
   x,y      double         Celestial Intermediate Pole (Note 2)
   xp,yp    double         coordinates of the pole (radians, Note 3)

Returned:
   rc2t     double[3][3]   celestial-to-terrestrial matrix (Note 4)

Notes:

   1. The TT and UT1 dates tta+ttb and uta+utb are Julian Dates,
   apportioned in any convenient way between the arguments uta and
   utb.  For example, JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any o
   these ways, among others:

            uta            utb

      2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
      2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
      2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
      2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

   The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
   cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
   acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
   between resolution and convenience.  In the case of uta,utb, the
   date & time method is best matched to the Earth rotation angle
   algorithm used:  maximum precision is delivered when the uta
   argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in question and the utb
   argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice versa.

   2. The Celestial Intermediate Pole coordinates are the x,y
   components of the unit vector in the Geocentric Celestial
   Reference System.

   3. The arguments xp and yp are the coordinates (in radians) of the
   Celestial Intermediate Pole with respect to the International
   Terrestrial Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003),
   measured along the meridians to 0 and 90 deg west respectively.

   4. The matrix rc2t transforms from celestial to terrestrial
   coordinates:

      [TRS] = RPOM * R_3(ERA) * RC2I * [CRS]

            = rc2t * [CRS]

   where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference
   System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
   Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), ERA is the Earth
   Rotation Angle and RPOM is the polar motion matrix.

   5. Although its name does not include "00", This function is in fact
   specific to the IAU 2000 models.

Called:
   iauC2ixy     celestial-to-intermediate matrix, given X,Y
   iauEra00     Earth rotation angle, IAU 2000
   iauSp00      the TIO locator s', IERS 2000
   iauPom00     polar motion matrix
   iauC2tcio    form CIO-based celestial-to-terrestrial matrix
