"""
Long-term precession of the ecliptic.

This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.

Status:  support function.

Given:
   epj     double         Julian epoch (TT)

Returned:
   vec     double[3]      ecliptic pole unit vector

Notes:

   1. The returned vector is with respect to the J2000.0 mean equator
   and equinox.

   2. The Vondrak et al. (2011, 2012) 400 millennia precession model
   agrees with the IAU 2006 precession at J2000.0 and stays within
   100 microarcseconds during the 20th and 21st centuries.  It is
   accurate to a few arcseconds throughout the historical period,
   worsening to a few tenths of a degree at the end of the
   +/- 200,000 year time span.
