"""
Form the matrix of nutation for a given date, IAU 1980 model.

This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.

Status:  support function.

Given:
   date1,date2    double          TDB date (Note 1)

Returned:
   rmatn          double[3][3]    nutation matrix

Notes:

   1. The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
   convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
   JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
   among others:

         date1          date2

      2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
      2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
      2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
      2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

   The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
   cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
   is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
   the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
   optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
   are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

   2. The matrix operates in the sense V(true) = rmatn * V(mean),
   where the p-vector V(true) is with respect to the true
   equatorial triad of date and the p-vector V(mean) is with
   respect to the mean equatorial triad of date.
