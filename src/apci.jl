"""
For a terrestrial observer, prepare star-independent astrometry
parameters for transformations between ICRS and geocentric CIRS
coordinates.  The Earth ephemeris and CIP/CIO are supplied by the
caller.

The parameters produced by this function are required in the
parallax, light deflection, aberration, and bias-precession-nutation
parts of the astrometric transformation chain.

This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.

Status:  support function.

Given:
    date1  double       TDB as a 2-part...
    date2  double       ...Julian Date (Note 1)
    ebpv   double[2][3] Earth barycentric position/velocity (au, au/day)
    ehp    double[3]    Earth heliocentric position (au)
    x,y    double       CIP X,Y (components of unit vector)
    s      double       the CIO locator s (radians)

Returned:
    astrom iauASTROM*   star-independent astrometry parameters:
        pmt    double       PM time interval (SSB, Julian years)
        eb     double[3]    SSB to observer (vector, au)
        eh     double[3]    Sun to observer (unit vector)
        em     double       distance from Sun to observer (au)
        v      double[3]    barycentric observer velocity (vector, c)
        bm1    double       sqrt(1-|v|^2): reciprocal of Lorenz factor
        bpn    double[3][3] bias-precession-nutation matrix
        along  double       unchanged
        xpl    double       unchanged
        ypl    double       unchanged
        sphi   double       unchanged
        cphi   double       unchanged
        diurab double       unchanged
        eral   double       unchanged
        refa   double       unchanged
        refb   double       unchanged

Notes:

    1. The TDB date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
    convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
    JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
    others:

        date1          date2

        2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
        2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
        2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
        2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

    The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
    where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
    acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
    argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
    resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
    good compromises between resolution and convenience.  For most
    applications of this function the choice will not be at all
    critical.

    TT can be used instead of TDB without any significant impact on
    accuracy.

    2. All the vectors are with respect to BCRS axes.

    3. In cases where the caller does not wish to provide the Earth
    ephemeris and CIP/CIO, the function iauApci13 can be used instead
    of the present function.  This computes the required quantities
    using other SOFA functions.

    4. This is one of several functions that inserts into the astrom
    structure star-independent parameters needed for the chain of
    astrometric transformations ICRS <-> GCRS <-> CIRS <-> observed.

    The various functions support different classes of observer and
    portions of the transformation chain:

        functions         observer        transformation

    iauApcg iauApcg13    geocentric      ICRS <-> GCRS
    iauApci iauApci13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> CIRS
    iauApco iauApco13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> observed
    iauApcs iauApcs13    space           ICRS <-> GCRS
    iauAper iauAper13    terrestrial     update Earth rotation
    iauApio iauApio13    terrestrial     CIRS <-> observed

    Those with names ending in "13" use contemporary SOFA models to
    compute the various ephemerides.  The others accept ephemerides
    supplied by the caller.

    The transformation from ICRS to GCRS covers space motion,
    parallax, light deflection, and aberration.  From GCRS to CIRS
    comprises frame bias and precession-nutation.  From CIRS to
    observed takes account of Earth rotation, polar motion, diurnal
    aberration and parallax (unless subsumed into the ICRS <-> GCRS
    transformation), and atmospheric refraction.

    5. The context structure astrom produced by this function is used by
    iauAtciq* and iauAticq*.

Called:
    iauApcg      astrometry parameters, ICRS-GCRS, geocenter
    iauC2ixys    celestial-to-intermediate matrix, given X,Y and s
