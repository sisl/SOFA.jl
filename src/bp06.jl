Frame bias and precession, IAU 2006.

This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.

Status:  support function.

Given:
   date1,date2  double         TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)

Returned:
   rb           double[3][3]   frame bias matrix (Note 2)
   rp           double[3][3]   precession matrix (Note 3)
   rbp          double[3][3]   bias-precession matrix (Note 4)

Notes:

   1. The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
   convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
   JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
   among others:

            date1         date2

      2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
      2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
      2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
      2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

   The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
   cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
   is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
   the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
   optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
   are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

   2. The matrix rb transforms vectors from GCRS to mean J2000.0 by
   applying frame bias.

   3. The matrix rp transforms vectors from mean J2000.0 to mean of
   date by applying precession.

   4. The matrix rbp transforms vectors from GCRS to mean of date by
   applying frame bias then precession.  It is the product rp x rb.

   5. It is permissible to re-use the same array in the returned
   arguments.  The arrays are filled in the order given.

Called:
   iauPfw06     bias-precession F-W angles, IAU 2006
   iauFw2m      F-W angles to r-matrix
   iauPmat06    PB matrix, IAU 2006
   iauTr        transpose r-matrix
   iauRxr       product of two r-matrices
   iauCr        copy r-matrix
