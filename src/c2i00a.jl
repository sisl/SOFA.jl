Form the celestial-to-intermediate matrix for a given date using the
IAU 2000A precession-nutation model.

This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.

Status:  support function.

Given:
   date1,date2 double       TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)

Returned:
   rc2i        double[3][3] celestial-to-intermediate matrix (Note 2)

Notes:

   1. The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
   convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
   JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
   among others:

         date1          date2

      2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
      2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
      2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
      2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

   The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
   cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
   is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
   the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
   optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
   are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

   2. The matrix rc2i is the first stage in the transformation from
   celestial to terrestrial coordinates:

      [TRS]  =  RPOM * R_3(ERA) * rc2i * [CRS]

            =  rc2t * [CRS]

   where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference
   System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
   Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), ERA is the Earth
   Rotation Angle and RPOM is the polar motion matrix.

   3. A faster, but slightly less accurate result (about 1 mas), can be
   obtained by using instead the iauC2i00b function.

Called:
   iauPnm00a    classical NPB matrix, IAU 2000A
   iauC2ibpn    celestial-to-intermediate matrix, given NPB matrix
